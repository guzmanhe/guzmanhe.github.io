            Present day traffic networks are unable to efficiently handle the daily car traffic through urban areas. We think that multiagent systems are an excellent way of doing microscopic simulation and thus provide possible solutions to the traffic control problem. In this paper, we present our simulation-based study to simulate traffic networks and optimize them via a multiagent cooperative system for traffic light control. This system simulates the traffic on an intersection, minimizing the time that each car has to wait in order to be served. Light agents can communicate each other in order to negotiate and share their light times. Our experimental results have shown how our approach can decrease the average car delay while the spawn probability is increased varying the service time and the number of traffic lights sets at a specific intersection. These results show important improvements using our multiagent light control system.

            Statistical methods have proven to be very effective when addressing linguistic problems, specially when dealing with Machine Translation. Nevertheless, Statistical Machine Translation effectiveness is limited to situations where large amounts of training data are available. Therefore, the broader the coverage of a SMT system is, the better the chances to get a reasonable output are. In this paper we propose a method to improve quality of translations of a phrase-based Machine Translation system by extending phrase-tables with the use of translation paraphrases learned from a third language. Our experiments were done translating from Spanish to English pivoting through French.

            In this paper we study in detail the relation between word alignment and phrase extraction. First, we analyze different word alignments according to several characteristics and compare them to hand-aligned data. Secondly, we analyzed the phrase-pairs generated by these alignments. We observed that the number of unaligned words has a large impact on the characteristics of the phrase table. A manual evaluation of phrase pair quality showed that the increase in the number of unaligned words results in a lower quality. Finally, we present translation results from using the number of unaligned words as features from which we obtain up to 2BP of improvement.

            This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised word alignment technique called EMDC that integrates discriminative and generative methods. A discriminative aligner is used to find high precision partial alignments that serve as constraints for a generative aligner which implements a constrained version of the EM algorithm. Experiments on small-size Chinese and Arabic tasks show consistent improvements on AER. We also experimented with moderate-size Chinese machine translation tasks and got an average of 0.5 point improvement on BLEU scores across five standard NIST test sets and four other test sets.

            The Impact of Statistical Word Alignment Quality and Structure in Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation

        abstract: >
            Statistical Word Alignments represent lexical word-to-word translations between source and target language sentences. They are considered the starting point for many state of the art Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. In phrase-based systems, word alignments are loosely linked to the translation model. Despite the improvements reached in word alignment quality, there has been a modest improvement in the end-to-end translation. Until recently, little or no attention was paid to the structural characteristics of word-alignments (e.g. unaligned words) and their impact in further stages of the phrase-based SMT pipeline. A better understanding of the relationship between word alignment and the entailing processes will help to identify the variables across the pipeline that most influence translation performance and can be    controlled by modifying word alignment’s characteristics.
            In this dissertation, we perform an in-depth study of the impact of word alignments at different stages of the phrase-based statistical machine translation pipeline, namely word alignment, phrase extraction, phrase scoring and decoding. Moreover, we establish a multivariate prediction model for different variables of word alignments, phrase tables and translation hypotheses. Based on those models, we identify the most important alignment variables and propose two alternatives to provide more control over alignment structure and thus improve SMT. Our results show that using alignment structure into decoding, via alignment gap features yields significant improvements, specially in situations where translation data is limited.
            During the development of this dissertation we discovered how different characteristics of the alignment impact Machine Translation. We observed that while good quality alignments yield good phrase-pairs, the consolidation of a translation model is dependent on the alignment structure, not quality. Human-alignments are more dense than the computer generated counterparts, which trend to be more sparse and precision-oriented. Trying to emulate human-like alignment structure resulted in poorer systems, because the resulting translation models trend to be more compact and lack translation options. On the other hand, more translation options, even if they are noisier, help to improve the quality of the translation. This is due to the fact that translation does not rely only on the translation model, but also other factors that help to discriminate the noise from bad translations (e.g. the language model). Lastly, when we provide the decoder with features that help it to make more `informed decisions'' we observe a clear improvement in translation quality. This was specially true for the discriminative alignments which inherently leave more unaligned words. The result is more evident in low-resource settings where having larger translation lexicons represent more translation options. Using simple features to help the decoder discriminate translation hypotheses, clearly showed consistent improvements.

            We study a problem with pairwise ranking optimization (PRO): that it tends to yield too short translations. We find that this is partially due to the inadequate smoothing in PRO’s BLEU+1, which boosts the precision component of BLEU but leaves the brevity penalty unchanged, thus destroying the balance between the two, compared to BLEU. It is also partially due to PRO optimizing for a sentence-level score without a global view on the overall length, which introducing a bias towards short translations; we show that letting PRO optimize a corpus-level BLEU yields a perfect length. Finally, we find some residual bias due to the interaction of PRO with BLEU+1: such a bias does not exist for a version of MIRA with sentence-level BLEU+1. We propose several ways to fix the length problem of PRO, including smoothing the brevity penalty, scaling the effective reference length, grounding the precision component, and unclipping the brevity penalty, which yield sizable improvements in test BLEU on two Arabic-English datasets: IWSLT (+0.65) and NIST (+0.37).

              abstract = {We study a problem with pairwise ranking optimization (PRO): that it tends to yield too short translations. We find that this is partially due to the inadequate smoothing in PRO’s BLEU+1, which boosts the precision component of BLEU but leaves the brevity penalty unchanged, thus destroying the balance between the two, compared to BLEU. It is also partially due to PRO optimizing for a sentence-level score without a global view on the overall length, which introducing a bias towards short translations; we show that letting PRO optimize a corpus-level BLEU yields a perfect length. Finally, we find some residual bias due to the interaction of PRO with BLEU+1: such a bias does not exist for a version of MIRA with sentence-level BLEU+1. We propose several ways to fix the length problem of PRO, including smoothing the brevity penalty, scaling the effective reference length, grounding the precision component, and unclipping the brevity penalty, which yield sizable improvements in test BLEU on two Arabic-English datasets: IWSLT (+0.65) and NIST (+0.37).}

            While experimenting with tuning on long sentences, we made an unexpected discovery: that PRO falls victim to monsters -overly long negative examples with very low BLEU+1 scores, which are unsuitable for learning and can cause testing BLEU to drop by several points absolute. We propose several effective ways to address the problem, using length- and BLEU+1- based cut-offs, outlier filters, stochastic sampling, and random acceptance. The best of these fixes not only slay and protect against monsters, but also yield higher stability for PRO as well as improved test-time BLEU scores. Thus, we recommend them to anybody using PRO, monster-believer or not.

            Research on statistical machine translation has focused on particular translation directions, typically with English as the target language, e.g., from Arabic to English. When we reverse the translation direction, the multiple reference translations turn into multiple possible inputs, which offers both challenges and opportunities. We propose and evaluate several strategies for making use of these multiple inputs: (a) select one of the datasets, (b) select the best input for each sentence, and (c) synthesize an input for each sentence by fusing the available inputs. Surprisingly, we find out that it is best to tune on the hardest available input, not on the one that yields the highest BLEU score. This finding has implications on how to pick good translators and how to select useful data for parameter optimization in SMT.

Combining the output of several systems yielded a gain of up to 3.4 BLEU points over the baseline.

We explore different approaches to align the segments, and extrinsically evaluate the resulting parallel corpus on the standard TED-talks tst-2010. We observe that the data can be successfully used for this task, and also observe an absolute improvement of 1.6 BLEU when it is used in combination with TED data. Finally, we analyze some of the specific challenges when translating the educational content.

            We present experiments in using discourse structure for improving machine translation evaluation. We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory. Then, we show that these measures can help improve a number of existing machine translation evaluation metrics both at the segmentand at the system-level. Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, and thus should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics.

            We present novel automatic metrics for machine translation evaluation that use discourse structure and convolution kernels to compare the discourse tree of an automatic translation with that of the human reference. We experiment with five transformations and augmentations of a base discourse tree representation based on the rhetorical structure theory, and we combine the kernel scores for each of them into a single score. Finally, we add other metrics from the ASIYA MT evaluation toolkit, and we tune the weights of the combination on actual human judgments. Experiments on the WMT12 and WMT13 metrics shared task datasets show correlation with human judgments that outperforms what the best systems that participated in these years achieved, both at the segment and at the system level.

            We present a pairwise learning-to-rank approach to machine translation evaluation that learns to differentiate better from worse translations in the context of a given reference. We integrate several layers of linguistic information encapsulated in tree-based structures, making use of both the reference and the system output simultaneously, thus bringing our ranking closer to how humans evaluate translations. Most importantly, instead of deciding upfront which types of features are important, we use the learning framework of preference re-ranking kernels to learn the features automatically. The evaluation results show that learning in the proposed framework yields better correlation with humans than computing the direct similarity over the same type of structures. Also, we show our structural kernel learning (SKL) can be a general framework for MT evaluation, in which syntactic and semantic information can be naturally incorporated.

            We present a novel framework for machine translation evaluation using neural networks in a pairwise setting, where the goal is to select the better translation from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation. In this framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses is compacted into relatively small distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer neural network that models the interaction between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. These compact representations are in turn based on word and sentence embeddings, which are learned using neural networks. The framework is flexible, allows for efficient learning and classification, and yields correlation with humans that rivals the state of the art.

            The paper describes the Egyptian Arabic-to-English statistical machine translation (SMT) system that the QCRI-Columbia-NYUAD (QCN) group submitted to the NIST OpenMT'2015 competition. The competition focused on informal dialectal Arabic, as used in SMS, chat, and speech. Thus, our efforts focused on processing and standardizing Arabic, e.g., using tools such as 3arrib and MADAMIRA. We further trained a phrase-based SMT system using state-of-the-art features and components such as operation sequence model, class-based language model, sparse features, neural network joint model, genre-based hierarchically-interpolated language model, unsupervised transliteration mining, phrase-table merging, and hypothesis combination. Our system ranked second on all three genres.

        abstract: >
            We study the impact of source length and verbosity of the tuning dataset on the performance of parameter optimizers such as MERT and PRO for statistical machine translation. In particular, we test whether the verbosity of the resulting translations can be modified by varying the length or the verbosity of the tuning sentences. We find that MERT learns the tuning set verbosity very well, while PRO is sensitive to both the verbosity and the length of the source sentences in the tuning set; yet, overall PRO learns best from high-verbosity tuning datasets.
            Given these dependencies, and potentially some other such as amount of reordering, number of unknown words, syntactic complexity, and evaluation measure, to mention just a few, we argue for the need of controlled evaluation scenarios, so that the selection of tuning set and optimization strategy does not overshadow scientific advances in modeling or decoding. In the mean time, until we develop such controlled scenarios, we recommend using PRO with a large verbosity tuning set, which, in our experiments, yields highest BLEU across datasets and language pairs.

            In this paper, we take a closer look at the MT evaluation process from a glass-box perspective using eye-tracking. We analyze two aspects of the evaluation task: the background of evaluators (monolingual or bilingual) and the sources of information available, and we evaluate them using time and consistency as criteria. Our findings show that monolinguals are slower but more consistent than bilinguals, especially when only target language information is available. When exposed to various sources of information, evaluators in general take more time and in the case of monolinguals, there is a drop in consistency. Our findings suggest that to have consistent and cost effective MT evaluations, it is better to use monolinguals with only target language information.

          Evaluation of machine translation (MT) into morphologically rich languages (MRL) has not been well studied despite posing many challenges. In this paper, we explore the use of embeddings obtained from different levels of lexical and morpho-syntactic linguistic analysis and show that they improve MT evaluation into an MRL. Specifically we report on Arabic, a language with complex and rich morphology. Our results show that using a neural-network model with different input representations produces results that clearly outperform the state-of-the-art for MT evaluation into Arabic, by almost over 75% increase in correlation with human judgments on pairwise MT evaluation quality task. More importantly, we demonstrate the usefulness of morpho-syntactic representations to model sentence similarity for MT evaluation and address complex linguistic phenomena of Arabic.

          Abstract We present a framework for machine translation evaluation using neural networks in a pairwise setting, where the goal is to select the better translation from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation. In this framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and the two hypotheses is embedded into compact distributed vector representations, and fed into a multi-layer neural network that models nonlinear interactions between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two hypotheses. We experiment with the benchmark datasets from the \WMT\ Metrics shared task, on which we obtain the best results published so far, with the basic network configuration. We also perform a series of experiments to analyze and understand the contribution of the different components of the network. We evaluate variants and extensions, including fine-tuning of the semantic embeddings, and sentence-based representations modeled with convolutional and recurrent neural networks. In summary, the proposed framework is flexible and generalizable, allows for efficient learning and scoring, and provides an \MT\ evaluation metric that correlates with human judgments, and is on par with the state of the art.
