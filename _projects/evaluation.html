description: >
  In this project, my team and I have explored using different levels of linguistic representations to improve Machine Translation Evaluation. We have looked at combining discourse trees, semantics and syntax to improve the state-of-the-art. We have used both structured (trees) and distributed (vector) representations to perform this task. Currently, we're looking at how humans evaluate translations using eyetracking.
