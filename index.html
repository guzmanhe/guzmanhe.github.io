      In 2015 I attended a <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=15122">
      Dagstuhl seminar on Formal Models of Graph Transformation in Natural Language Processing</a>.
      Stay tuned for more!

      Prospective Ph.D. students should <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/study">apply to study in the ILCC</a>. 
      Search for my name <a href="http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/study/possible-phd-topics-in-ilcc">here</a>
      for a (non-exhaustive) list of possible thesis topics. If you are interested in the machine
      learning aspects of natural language processing you can also apply to the 
      <a href="http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/">CDT in Data Science</a>, and
      if you are interested in working with me on GPGPU algorithms, you can  apply 
      to the <a href="http://pervasiveparallelism.inf.ed.ac.uk/">CDT in Pervasive Parallelism</a>.
      I am affiliated with both centers.

      The LDC released <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014T23">a four-way parallel corpus</a> 
      of speech, transcriptions, translation, and ASR lattices that I developed with colleagues at 
      Johns Hopkins University.

      I worked with an excellent team of researchers led by <a href="http://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/">Martha Palmer</a> on 
      <a href="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/archive/ws14-summer-workshop/groups/amr-mt/">Cross-lingual abstract meaning representations for machine translation</a> at the <a href="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/archive/ws14-summer-workshop/">2014 Fred Jelinek memorial CLSP workshop</a> in Prague.
      The team produced many interesting results. <a href="http://lectures.ms.mff.cuni.cz/view.php?rec=231">Here is a video</a> of our presentation
      from the final day of the workshop. I am the first speaker, and my students Naomi and Adi also give presentations. Stay tuned for more!

      I was awarded an
      <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1349902">NSF grant</a>
      for a project on formal language theory and translation.

<p>
  The biggest barrier to global communication is the fact that we speak many 
  different languages. My research focuses on technology that will break this 
  barrier, in particular systems that learn to translate from big data (like 
  <a href="http://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a>,
  <a href="http://www.bing.com/translator">Bing Translator</a>, and
  <a href="http://www.freetranslation.com/">SDL Free Translation</a>), and
  their integration with speech and search technologies. 
  Improvements to these systems depend on extensions and applications of 
  machine learning, formal language theory, linguistics, and
  algorithms. I am interested in many problems in these fields.
