abstract: 'In this paper we present an analysis of a phrase-based machine translation
  methodology that integrates paraphrases obtained from an intermediary language (French)
  for translations between Spanish and English. The purpose of the research presented
  in this document is to find out how much extra information (i.e. improvements in
  translation quality) can be found when using Translation Paraphrases (TPs). In this
  document we present an extensive statistical analysis to support conclusions.
