abstract: 'The paper describes the Egyptian Arabic-to-English statistical machine
  translation (SMT) system that the QCRI-Columbia-NYUAD (QCN) group submitted to the
  NIST OpenMT''2015 competition. The competition focused on informal dialectal Arabic,
  as used in SMS, chat, and speech. Thus, our efforts focused on processing and standardizing
  Arabic, e.g., using tools such as 3arrib and MADAMIRA. We further trained a phrase-based
  SMT system using state-of-the-art features and components such as operation sequence
  model, class-based language model, sparse features, neural network joint model,
  genre-based hierarchically-interpolated language model, unsupervised transliteration
  mining, phrase-table merging, and hypothesis combination. Our system ranked second
  on all three genres.
