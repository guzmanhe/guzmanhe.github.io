abstract: 'While experimenting with tuning on long sentences, we made an unexpected
  discovery: that PRO falls victim to monsters -overly long negative examples with
  very low BLEU+1 scores, which are unsuitable for learning and can cause testing
  BLEU to drop by several points absolute. We propose several effective ways to address
  the problem, using length- and BLEU+1- based cut-offs, outlier filters, stochastic
  sampling, and random acceptance. The best of these fixes not only slay and protect
  against monsters, but also yield higher stability for PRO as well as improved test-time
  BLEU scores. Thus, we recommend them to anybody using PRO, monster-believer or not.
