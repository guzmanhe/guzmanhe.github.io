abstract: 'Evaluation of machine translation (MT) into morphologically rich languages
  (MRL) has not been well studied despite posing many challenges. In this paper, we
  explore the use of embeddings obtained from different levels of lexical and morpho-syntactic
  linguistic analysis and show that they improve MT evaluation into an MRL. Specifically
  we report on Arabic, a language with complex and rich morphology. Our results show
  that using a neural-network model with different input representations produces
  results that clearly outperform the state-of-the-art for MT evaluation into Arabic,
  by almost over 75% increase in correlation with human judgments on pairwise MT evaluation
  quality task. More importantly, we demonstrate the usefulness of morpho-syntactic
  representations to model sentence similarity for MT evaluation and address complex
  linguistic phenomena of Arabic.
