abstract: 'Statistical Word Alignments represent lexical word-to-word translations
  between source and target language sentences. They are considered the starting point
  for many state of the art Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. In phrase-based
  systems, word alignments are loosely linked to the translation model. Despite the
  improvements reached in word alignment quality, there has been a modest improvement
  in the end-to-end translation. Until recently, little or no attention was paid to
  the structural characteristics of word-alignments (e.g. unaligned words) and their
  impact in further stages of the phrase-based SMT pipeline. A better understanding
  of the relationship between word alignment and the entailing processes will help
  to identify the variables across the pipeline that most influence translation performance
  and can be    controlled by modifying word alignment’s characteristics. In this
  dissertation, we perform an in-depth study of the impact of word alignments at different
  stages of the phrase-based statistical machine translation pipeline, namely word
  alignment, phrase extraction, phrase scoring and decoding. Moreover, we establish
  a multivariate prediction model for different variables of word alignments, phrase
  tables and translation hypotheses. Based on those models, we identify the most important
  alignment variables and propose two alternatives to provide more control over alignment
  structure and thus improve SMT. Our results show that using alignment structure
  into decoding, via alignment gap features yields significant improvements, specially
  in situations where translation data is limited. During the development of this
  dissertation we discovered how different characteristics of the alignment impact
  Machine Translation. We observed that while good quality alignments yield good phrase-pairs,
  the consolidation of a translation model is dependent on the alignment structure,
  not quality. Human-alignments are more dense than the computer generated counterparts,
  which trend to be more sparse and precision-oriented. Trying to emulate human-like
  alignment structure resulted in poorer systems, because the resulting translation
  models trend to be more compact and lack translation options. On the other hand,
  more translation options, even if they are noisier, help to improve the quality
  of the translation. This is due to the fact that translation does not rely only
  on the translation model, but also other factors that help to discriminate the noise
  from bad translations (e.g. the language model). Lastly, when we provide the decoder
  with features that help it to make more `informed decisions'''' we observe a clear
  improvement in translation quality. This was specially true for the discriminative
  alignments which inherently leave more unaligned words. The result is more evident
  in low-resource settings where having larger translation lexicons represent more
  translation options. Using simple features to help the decoder discriminate translation
  hypotheses, clearly showed consistent improvements.
