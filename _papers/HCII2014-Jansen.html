abstract: 'In this paper, we present the main features of the Amara project, and its
  impact on the accessibility landscape with the use of innovative technology. We
  also show the effectiveness of volunteer communities in addressing large subtitling
  and translation tasks, that accompany the ever-growing amounts of online video content.
  Furthermore, we present two different applications for the platform. First, we examine
  the growing interest of organizations to build their own subtitling communities.
  Second, we present how the community-generated material can be used to advance the
  state-of-the-art of research in fields such as Statistical Machine Translation with
  focus on educational translation. We provide examples on how both tasks can be achieved
  successfully.
