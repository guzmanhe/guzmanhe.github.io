abstract: 'Statistical methods have proven to be very effective when addressing linguistic
  problems, specially when dealing with Machine Translation. Nevertheless, Statistical
  Machine Translation effectiveness is limited to situations where large amounts of
  training data are available. Therefore, the broader the coverage of a SMT system
  is, the better the chances to get a reasonable output are. In this paper we propose
  a method to improve quality of translations of a phrase-based Machine Translation
  system by extending phrase-tables with the use of translation paraphrases learned
  from a third language. Our experiments were done translating from Spanish to English
  pivoting through French.
